# ERL Apartment Availability Checker

This telegram bot checks for availble apartments in ERL Deggendorf. For security reasons, I have excluded the bot token from the Git repository.
If you wish to use this script with your own bot, simply replace the `variables.token` with your own bot's token.

## Getting Started

To get started:

use the Live bot under https://t.me/ERLcheckerbot  
use /look to check for availability  
use /fetch to fetch data that instant and check for availability

#### or alternativaly
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Replace `variables.token` with your bot's token in the script.
3. Run the script to check apartment availability.


### NEW VERSION

The new version checks the availability automatically. But you must send a command before that. will not announce here as of yet. if you know how to code, it's visible in the source code, and it works when you figure it out.

### Important

**Note**: If you are from ERL and have concerns about this repository, please send me a message, and I will take appropriate action, including removing the repository if necessary.
