# Apartment Availability Checker

This script fetches information about available apartments from a specific link and determines if apartments in ERL Deggendorf are currently available or not. For security reasons, I have excluded the bot token from the Git repository.

If you wish to use this script with your own bot, simply replace the `variables.token` with your bot's token.

**Note**: If you are from ERL and have concerns about this repository, please send me a message, and I will take appropriate action, including removing the repository if necessary.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Replace `variables.token` with your bot's token in the script.
3. Run the script to check apartment availability.

or just use the online bot under https://t.me/ERLcheckerbot
use /job to check for availability

Important: bot is still new and im working on automation and other features!
Have pateince!!
